 * This interface represents a component which is responsible for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain_(computing)"
 * target="_blank">cluster split-brain</a> detection.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this component should perform a quick check (possibly by consulting with some shared resource) and verify that local
 * node can reach other nodes.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Cluster service calls this component when any of the following events happens:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Right before the local node joins to the cluster</li>
 * <li>When some other node leaves the cluster</li>
 * <li>Periodically, if {@link ClusterServiceFactory#setSplitBrainCheckInterval(long)} is set to a positive value</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * If this component detects that local node can't reach other nodes then the cluster service will take actions according to the {@link
 * SplitBrainAction} defined in its {@link ClusterServiceFactory#setSplitBrainDetector(SplitBrainDetector) configuration}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that it is possible combine multiple detectors with the help of {@link SplitBrainDetectorGroup}.
